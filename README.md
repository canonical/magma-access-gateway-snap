# magma-access-gateway-snap

## Description

Magma is an open-source software platform that gives network operators a mobile core network
solution. Magma has three major components:

1. **Access Gateway**
2. Orchestrator
3. Federation Gateway

The Access Gateway (AGW) provides network services and policy enforcement. In an LTE network,
the AGW implements an evolved packet core (EPC), and a combination of an AAA and a PGW. It works
with existing, unmodified commercial radio hardware.<br>
For more information on Magma please visit the [official website](https://magmacore.org/).

With this [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/) user can easily deploy Magma Access Gateway.
